## 📖 Overview

In just eight weeks between January and February 2026, ten major open-weight LLM architectures were released.<br>
GLM-5 recorded benchmark scores on par with GPT-5.2 and Claude Opus 4.6.<br>
Step 3.5 Flash surpassed DeepSeek V3.2 — a model three times its size.

**The performance gap between proprietary models (AI models developed and served behind closed doors by companies, such as GPT and Claude)<br>
and open-weight models (AI models whose core trained "weights" are publicly available,<br>
allowing anyone to download and run them) has already vanished.**

The structural change triggered by this fact goes far beyond "more model choices."<br>
The axis of competition is shifting from **"which model is smartest" to "where inference is executed and who controls the data."**

This book unpacks this structural shift from four perspectives:

- **Evidence of performance convergence** — Why the gap has vanished now
- **The new axes of competition** — Efficiency, speed, on-device, privacy
- **Enterprise strategy implications** — The new concept of an Inference Location Portfolio
- **Irreversible consumer behavior change** — From subscription fatigue to the irreversible migration to on-device AI

In the final chapter, all of these are connected to the author's Depth & Velocity (D&V) methodology,<br>
charting a new horizon for business development in the Edge AI era.

## 🏗️ Structure

This book comprises four parts plus a conclusion.

### Part 1: The Convergence — Structural Evidence That the Performance Gap Has Vanished

| Theme | Content |
|-------|---------|
| The Spring 2026 Explosion | 10 architectures in 8 weeks: GLM-5, Kimi K2.5, Step 3.5 Flash, Qwen3-Coder-Next, and more |
| Benchmark Convergence | Verified across three axes: AI Index, Vectara Hallucination Leaderboard, SWE-Bench Pro |
| Residual Value of Proprietary APIs | The shift from "performance premium" to "reliability premium" |
| Democratization of Scaling Laws | Frontier performance has become a reproducible engineering achievement |

### Part 2: The New Battleground — Efficiency, Speed, and On-Device as the New Axes of Competition

| Theme | Content |
|-------|---------|
| Inference Efficiency (Tokens/sec per Dollar) | Step 3.5 Flash: 100–350 tok/sec with 262K context. 11B active retaining 196B knowledge |
| On-Device Feasibility | Nanbeige 4.1 3B demonstrated on smartphone. Workstation and laptop already production-ready |
| Architectural Innovation | Simultaneous maturation of Mixture-of-Experts (MoE), Multi-Token Prediction (MTP), Sliding Window Attention (SWA), and Quantization |
| Privacy and Data Sovereignty | The psychologically unbridgeable gap between "managed securely" and "never sent in the first place" |

### Part 3: Enterprise Implications — Five Structural Shifts Rewriting Enterprise AI Strategy

| Theme | Content |
|-------|---------|
| Shift 1 | From "which model" to "where to run inference" — simultaneously determining data residency, IP, and financial structure |
| Shift 2 | From OpEx (API billing) to CapEx (inference infrastructure investment) — Lenovo TCO analysis: breakeven under 4 months, up to 18× cost advantage |
| Shift 3 | Reassessing vendor lock-in risk — from "an acceptable necessity" to "a risk of strategic negligence" |
| Shift 4 | Inference Location Portfolio (three-tier design of Cloud API / On-Premise / Edge with dynamic optimization) |
| Shift 5 | From model performance to Context Engineering — structural alignment with Palantir's ontology strategy |

### Part 4: The Consumer Shift — Five Forces Driving the Irreversible Migration to On-Device AI

| Theme | Content |
|-------|---------|
| Force 1: Subscription Fatigue | When the marginal cost of on-device AI is zero, $20/month becomes "a luxury I can live without" |
| Force 2: The Instinct for Privacy | The most important questions people ask AI are the ones they least want anyone else to know about |
| Force 3: The Irreversibility of Latency | Users who experience instant response cannot go back to cloud latency. Speed expectations move in one direction only |
| Force 4: Offline Availability | For billions of people in the Global South, on-device AI is the only option |
| Force 5: The Sense of Ownership | The psychological ownership of "my AI, running on my device" is more powerful than any TCO calculation |
| Flywheel | The five forces reinforce one another and all act irreversibly in the same direction |

### Conclusion: The D&V Perspective on the Edge AI Era

| Theme | Content |
|-------|---------|
| Redefining Depth | Model performance has been democratized. The new Depth is structuring your organization's proprietary data and Context Engineering |
| Redefining Velocity | From "speed of adopting the latest API" to "speed of deploying intelligence to the edge" |
| Ecosystem Connections | A system of six open-source knowledge repositories that cross-reference one another |
| Closing Words | Technology makes it possible, economics makes it rational, society demands it. This migration cannot be stopped |

## 🔑 Core of This Book

### Core Thesis

The benchmark performance gap between open-weight LLMs and proprietary models has effectively vanished.<br>
The question is no longer "which model is best" but<br>
**"where inference is executed and who controls the data."**<br>
The answer will determine the trajectory of enterprise AI strategy and consumer technology for the next decade.<br>

This book argues that economic, psychological, and technological structural forces<br>
make edge AI and on-device inference not merely **"possible" but "inevitable."**

### Inference Location Portfolio (Three-Tier Model)

| Tier | Deployment | Use Case | Example Models |
|------|------------|----------|----------------|
| Tier 1 | Cloud API | Highest-accuracy decisions, instant access to latest models, experimental workloads | GPT-5.2, Claude Opus 4.6 |
| Tier 2 | On-Premise / Private Cloud | Confidential data processing, regulatory compliance, predictable high-volume workloads | GLM-5 (744B MoE), Qwen3.5 class |
| Tier 3 | Edge / On-Device | Real-time operations, offline environments, factories, retail, vehicles | Nanbeige 4.1 3B class, quantized 7B–14B |

### Consumer Flywheel

Subscription fatigue (economic motive)
→ User tries on-device AI
→ Experiences the comfort of privacy
→ Gets accustomed to instant response
→ Discovers it works offline
→ A sense of "my own AI" takes root
→ Cancels cloud AI subscription
→ Commitment to on-device deepens further

**Once this flywheel begins to turn, a structural return to cloud AI becomes extremely unlikely —<br>
because all five forces act in one direction only.**
